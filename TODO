Framework:
 - Rework configuration (JSON, perhaps) to support global and per-check scope
 - Build out support for additional AST node types
 - Consider additional helper functions that could make writing tests simpler

Possible Tests:
 - XSS exposure (e.g. usage of mark_safe())
 - Hardcoded passwords
 - Logging sensitive information
 - SQL commands into SQL Alchemy
 - Weak crypto primitives
 - Port binding 0.0.0.0
 - SSLv2 forced
 - Sudo calls
 - De-serializing (Pickle?  YAML?  JSON?)
 - Taint checking / lack of input validation (object returned by requests.get()/.post() has headers, content, text, json attributes)
