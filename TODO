Framework:
 - Build out support for additional AST node types
 - Consider additional helper functions that could make writing tests simpler

Existing tests:
 - Review for accuracy or possible improvements.

New tests:
 - Hardcoded passwords
 - Logging sensitive information
 - SQL commands into SQL Alchemy
 - Weak crypto primitives
 - SSLv2 forced
 - Sudo calls
 - De-serializing (Pickle?  YAML?  JSON?)
 - Taint checking / lack of input validation (e.g. object returned by requests.get()/.post() has headers, content, text, json attributes) - this will likely get complicated
