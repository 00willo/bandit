possible tests:
 - Popen shell=True
 - import of possibly-dangerous imports
 - bad file perms (os.chmod https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.chmod)
 - taint checking / lack of input validation (object returned by requests.get()/.post() has headers, content, text, json attributes)

 - hardcoded passwords
 - logging sensitive information
 - sql commands into sql alchemy
 - poor crypto primitives
 - temp file creation
 - wildcard injection
 - port binding 0.0.0.0
 - TLS requests w/out cert checks
 - SSLv2 forced
 - eval/exec functions
 - sudo calls
 - de-serializing (pickle?  yaml?  json?)
